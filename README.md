ðŸš€ Naim's Stellar Portfolio Website ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the GitHub repo of my mind-blowing, earth-shattering, universe-altering portfolio website! (Okay, maybe I'm overselling it a bit, but my mom thinks it's pretty cool.)
What's This All About?
This is a simple one-pager that showcases my awesome skills, projects, and the fact that I can center a div without breaking into a cold sweat. It's like my online resume, but way cooler and with 100% more GIFs.
Features

Responsive Design: Works on everything from a smartwatch to a smart fridge. (Note: I haven't actually tested it on a smart fridge, but I'm pretty confident.)
Project Showcase: Where I show off my coding prowess and pretend that all my projects were bug-free from day one.
About Me Section: Learn about the coding wizard behind the keyboard. Spoiler alert: I'm not actually a wizard, but I do own a Harry Potter wand.
Contact Form: Reach out to me! But please, no spam about extending my car's warranty. I don't even own a car.

Technologies Used

HTML (because obviously)
CSS (making things pretty since... well, since CSS was invented)
JavaScript (for all those fancy animations that make you go "Oooh!")
Coffee (the real MVP here)

# üöÄ Naim's Stellar Portfolio Website üåü

## Warning: Extreme Awesomeness Ahead! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Caution: This website contains dangerously high levels of creativity, wit, and mad coding skills. Side effects may include uncontrollable urges to hire me, spontaneous bouts of admiration, and a sudden realization that your own website needs an upgrade. Proceed at your own risk! üòé

Welcome to the GitHub repo of my mind-blowing, earth-shattering, universe-altering portfolio website! (Okay, maybe I'm overselling it a bit, but my mom thinks it's pretty cool.)

## What's This All About?

This is a simple one-pager that showcases my awesome skills, projects, and the fact that I can center a div without breaking into a cold sweat. It's like my online resume, but way cooler and with 100% more GIFs.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on everything from a smartwatch to a smart fridge. (Note: I haven't actually tested it on a smart fridge, but I'm pretty confident.)
- **Project Showcase**: Where I show off my coding prowess and pretend that all my projects were bug-free from day one.
- **About Me Section**: Learn about the coding wizard behind the keyboard. Spoiler alert: I'm not actually a wizard, but I do own a Harry Potter wand.
- **Contact Form**: Reach out to me! But please, no spam about extending my car's warranty. I don't even own a car.

## Technologies Used

- HTML (because obviously)
- CSS (making things pretty since... well, since CSS was invented)
- JavaScript (for all those fancy animations that make you go "Oooh!")
- Coffee (the real MVP here)

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Be amazed
4. (Optional) Hire me

## Contributing

Found a typo? Want to add a cool feature? Accidentally achieved sentience while browsing my code? Feel free to open a PR!

## Contact

If you want to reach out, you can find me:
- Coding at midnight
- Debugging in my dreams
- Or just use the contact form on the website, you know, like a normal person

Remember, in the world of web development, we don't make mistakes -- just happy little 404s!
